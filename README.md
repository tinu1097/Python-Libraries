# NUMPY
NumPy is a Python package. It stands for 'Numerical Python'. It is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing of array
Numeric, the ancestor of NumPy, was developed by Jim Hugunin. Another package Numarray was also developed, having some additional functionalities. In 2005, Travis Oliphant created NumPy package by incorporating the features of Numarray into Numeric package. There are many contributors to this open source project.

NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is one of the most important foundational pack‐
ages for numerical computing in Python. Most computational packages providing
scientific functionality use NumPy’s array objects as the lingua franca(as like a bridge/interpreter)for data exchange.NumPy arrays are like Python’s built-in list type, but NumPy arrays provide much more efficient storage and data operations as the arrays grow larger in size.

NumPy contains, among other things:
A fast and efficient multidimensional array object ndarray Linear algebra operations, Fourier transform, and random number generation
Functions for performing element-wise computations with arrays or mathematical operations between arrays
. ndarray, an efficient multidimensional array providing fast array-oriented arithmetic operations and flexible broadcasting capabilities.
• Mathematical functions for fast operations on entire arrays of data without having to write loops.
• Tools for reading/writing array data to disk and working with memory-mapped files.
• Linear algebra, random number generation, and Fourier transform capabilities

# ARRAY
Array is a container which can hold a fix number of items and these items should be of the same data type. Most of the data structures make use of arrays to implement their algorithms. Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Array.

Element− Each item stored in an array is called an element.
Index − Each location of an element in an array has a numerical index, which is used to identify the element.

Following are the basic operations supported by an array.
Traverse − print all the array elements one by one.
Insertion − Adds an element at the given index.
Deletion − Deletes an element at the given index.
Search − Searches an element using the given index or by the value.
Update − Updates an element at the given index.
